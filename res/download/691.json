All the tutorial I&#39;ve seen gave a very simple example for an app that only uses Activity and not Fragments.

All online example have idlingResource inside an Activity, since no example ever shows how to deal with fragments. I need to pass it to the test so I can register it.\r\n\r\n4. Talk about registration, is this the correct way to register it?\r\n\r\n    IdlingRegistry.getInstance().register(idlingResource);\r\n\r\nAll solutions I&#39;ve found uses \r\n\r\n    Espresso.unregisterIdlingResources(mIdlingResource);\r\nBut this is already deprecated\r\n\r\n",

            "body_markdown": "I&#39;m working on a small project at work which requires multiple AJAX calls to various API endpoints. The first three require data from one another successively, and the last three can be ran independently as they do not have any relationship to the first three.\r\n\r\nThis is my first major foray into async/await, and actually utilizing promises for their intended purpose, and I&#39;ve come to a point of confusion as to how to handle any exceptions. We&#39;re using Vue.js as our front-end framework and consuming JSON responses.\r\n\r\nI call the functions containing my requests with this function:\r\n\r\n    fetchAllData: async function() {\r\n        await this.getList()\r\n        await this.getSecondListRelatedToFirst()\r\n        await this.getThirdListRelatedToFirstAndSecond()\r\n        this.getDateRange()\r\n        getConversions()\r\n        getVolumes()\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe how the requests are running right now:\r\n\r\n    this.getList()\r\n    |------------&gt; this.getSecondListRelatedToFirst()\r\n                  |----------&gt; this.getThirdListRelatedToFirstAndSecond()\r\n                  |------&gt; this.getDateRange()\r\n                  |------&gt; getConversions()\r\n                  |------&gt; getVolumes()\r\n\r\n\r\n`this.getList()` runs, then `this.getSecondListRelatedToFirst()` runs when `this.getList()` resolves, and the last four run when `this.getSecondListRelatedToFirst()` resolves.\r\n\r\nThe requests are all structured fairly similar to this:\r\n\r\n    getList: function () {\r\n        return $.ajax({\r\n            type: &quot;GET&quot;,\r\n            url: &#39;/api/endpoint&#39;,\r\n            dataType: &#39;json&#39;,\r\n            data: {\r\n                param_one  : param_one,\r\n                param_two  : param_two,\r\n                param_three: param_three,\r\n                ...\r\n            }\r\n        })\r\n        .then(function(data, status, xhr) {\r\n             let temp = _.map(data, function (d) {\r\n                 return {\r\n                     // map some data here         \r\n                 }\r\n             }.bind(this));\r\n\r\n        }, function(jqXhr, textStatus, errorThrown) {\r\n                    console.error(errorThrown);\r\n        })\r\n        .catch(function(error){\r\n             console.log.bind(error)\r\n    })\r\n\r\nThe basic idea is once the response comes back from the server, I manipulate the data into something more easily consumable by Vue, and move along with rendering the page.\r\n\r\nComing full circle, to the first function, `fetchAllData`, which is called in the `mounted` lifecycle property like so:\r\n\r\n    $.when( this.fetchAllData() )\r\n     .then( function() {\r\n        // do some other stuff\r\n     })\r\n     .fail(\r\n          console.log.bind(console);\r\n     );\r\n\r\nAnd this is where my question lies. Considering I&#39;m doing error catching at the AJAX level (with the then, catch blocks), do I need to do error catching here as well? And if so, how would I achieve that in the `$.when` block?
