            "body_markdown": "I am forced to move an old website that has been running well for years on a remote windows server using classic ASP (VBScript) and MS access databases. \r\n\r\nThe new hosting company (123-reg) does not support MS Access on their Windows server, so I am now using MySQL. I have used MySQL successfully on other sites but always using PHP rather than classic ASP, so I have never connected to a MySQL database from ASP before.\r\n\r\nThe website has hundreds of pages and I was hoping that all I had to do was change the connection strings. However I now get a 500 error \r\n\r\n&gt; 80004005|[Microsoft] ODBC_Driver_Manager]_Data_source_name_not_found_and_no_default_driver_specified\r\n\r\n which has stumped me.\r\n\r\nI have tried\r\n\r\n    set Conn=server.createobject(&quot;ADODB.CONNECTION&quot;)\r\n    set rs = server.createobject(&quot;ADODB.Recordset&quot;)\r\n    conn.open &quot;DRIVER={MySQL ODBC 3.51 Driver}; SERVER=&quot; &amp; servername &amp; &quot;; DATABASE=&quot; &amp; database &amp; &quot;; UID=&quot; &amp; username &amp; &quot;;PASSWORD=&quot; &amp; pword &amp; &quot;; OPTION=3;&quot;\r\n\r\nI have also tried:\r\n\r\n    conn.open &quot;DRIVER={SQL Server};SERVER=&quot; &amp; servername &amp; &quot;\\SQLEXPRESS;DATABASE=&quot; &amp; database &amp; &quot;;UID=&quot; &amp; username &amp; &quot;;PWD=&quot; &amp; pword&quot;\r\nand after reading [this previous answer][1] to a similar queation:\r\n\r\n    conn.open &quot;DRIVER={MySQL ODBC 5.1 Driver}; SERVER=&quot; &amp; servername &amp; &quot;; DATABASE=&quot; &amp; database &amp; &quot;; UID=&quot; &amp; username &amp; &quot;;PASSWORD=&quot; &amp; pword &amp; &quot;; OPTION=3;charset=utf8;&quot;\r\n\r\nand still get the same error.\r\n\r\nI have hunted the Internet and this site but whenever I find information it assumes that I am using my own server, which I am not. The page at: https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/kb/306345 suggests that I make changes to the server registry, which of course I am unable to do, and in any case I find it hard to accept that a company as large as 123-reg has to change things on their server to allow me to connect to a database. \r\n\r\nI therefore come to the conclusion that I have something wrong (probably something simple) with my connection coding. \r\n\r\nI did raise a ticket with 123-reg but they told me it is a coding problem and they do not help with that, which reinforces my theory.\r\n\r\nI would be deeply appreciative for any help on this. I do plan to re-write the site in PHP now and I know that I can make that work well, but as there are hundreds of pages to code it will take me months and I am looking for a quick fix to get the site live again using the current pages whilst I re-write the whole site in PHP.\r\n\r\nMany thanks\r\n\r\nTog\r\n\r\nUpdate: 11th January\r\n123-reg have come back to me and said the ODBC version is 5.1.8.
