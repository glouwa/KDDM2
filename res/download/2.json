These requirements are based on the most common\r\n&gt; questions posted every day and may be added to as needed. They all\r\n&gt; require the same basic code structure to get to each of the scenarios\r\n&gt; and they are generally dependent on one another.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n###How do you correctly read various types of input from `System.in` supplied by the user and act upon it?\r\n\r\n 1. I want to be able to have my program automatically wait for the next input after each previous input as well.\r\n\r\n 1. I want to know how to detect an *exit* command and end my program when that command is entered.\r\n\r\n 1. I want to know how to match multiple commands for the *exit* command in a case-insensitive way.\r\n\r\n 1. I want to be able to match regular expression patterns as well as the built-in primitives. For example, how to match what appears to be a date ( `2014/10/18` )?\r\n\r\n 1. I want to know how to match things that might not easily be implemented with regular expression matching - for example, an URL ( `http://google.com` ).\r\n\r\n###Motivation:\r\n\r\nIn the Java world, `Scanner` is a special case, it is an extremely finicky class that teachers should not give new students instructions to use. In most cases the instructors do not even know how to use it correctly.\r\n\r\nUsing `Scanner` implies all the other things this question and answer mentions. It is never just about `Scanner` it is about how to solve these common problems with `Scanner` that are always co morbid problems in almost all the question that get `Scanner` wrong.
