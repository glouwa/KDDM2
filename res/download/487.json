The code that I&#39;m using works, however the results show the logo with fuzzy black edges.

The image file that is coming in is from a file upload form field. And most of the files are organization logos.

The reason that I have to recreate it is because I&#39;m also using [cropper.js][1], which is a tool that lets you zoom in or crop the file being uploaded, and I need the final file to be 450x280 regardless of how big or small the file uploaded was. So in my code, `$x, $y, $width, $height` are sent by cropper.js after the user has manipulated the original image. \r\n\r\nAs I said, the image manipulation is working correctly. The only problem is that when I user submits a png with transparency, the logo is real fuzzy, with black edges. When I change black to another color in `$black = imagecolorallocate($newImage, 0, 0, 0);` I loose all of the transparency.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a sample input and output file.

Pretty easy until now. The problem is that the <code>ArrayList&lt;SubItem&gt;</code> attribute inside <code>Arraylist&lt;Item&gt;</code> will also be used to repeat another View, and that is where I am stuck. I have no idea of how to do it and also have not found any example on that library wiki, neither on google or github using that library. Everybody using this library put the multiple xml element manually, hardcoded, but I want to repeat it multiple times programmatically. Check the step 1 on the lib wiki: <a href=\"https://github.com/daimajia/AndroidSwipeLayout/wiki/usage\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/daimajia/AndroidSwipeLayout/wiki/usage</a></p>\n\n<p>There is a <code>surface view</code> and a <code>bottom view</code>. There can be multiple <code>bottom view</code> elements, and this is the one I want to repeat in a <code>Listview</code> (or it can be any other android feature capable of repeating views).</p>\n\n<p>Can anyone please help me with this?? Any code of someone repeating items inside an already repeated item will be helpful.</p>\n"
