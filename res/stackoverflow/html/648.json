However I have some tables with a prefix of 'PRIVATE'. I want miniroot to NOT have access to this. </p>\n\n<p>I saw an answer on here on how to revoke access from a DB doing sometihng like this </p>\n\n<pre><code>REVOKE all on PRIVATE.* from 'miniroot'@'localhost';\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However this does not work and says <code>ERROR 1141 (42000): There is no such grant defined for user 'miniroot' on host 'localhost'</code> Which is true, I need my miniroot to have access to new DB's as they get created not a specific set. So I cant just remove one from the set. Any idea on how I might make this work?</p>\n"

            "body_markdown": "So I have created a system at our office where I would use cloud computing systems (mainly Dropbox and Google Drive) to pull data daily. The system is as follows:\r\n\r\n**Step 1 (If the file is not in the clouds yet):**\r\nThe relevant files (usually Excel and Access files) located at each User&#39;s desktop are automatically transferred to either Dropbox or Google Drive everyday at 4:30 pm by using a simple script and the Task Scheduler to automate the script activation. The folders where the files are saved on in Dropbox or Google Drive is shared to my account/employee account which will auto-sync on their computers. The script used is shown below:\r\n\r\n    xcopy &quot;C:\\Users\\Asus\\Desktop\\Test.MDB&quot; &quot;C:\\Users\\Asus\\Google Drive&quot; /Y /H /E /F /I\r\n    exit\r\n\r\n**Step 2:** In my the Excel and/or Access files where I need the relevant files on, I will create a connection to link the files together. The image is shown below:\r\n\r\n[![Establishing a connection][1]][1]\r\n\r\nThe connection string i&#39;m using is an OLEDB connection string because my Access file is password protected. The string is shown below:\r\n\r\n    Provider=Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0;C:\\Users\\Asus\\Sample;Jet OLEDB:Database Password=&quot;abc123&quot;;\r\n\r\n**Step 3:** I will then automatically refresh the data retrieved from the data connection by using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) that is activated whenever the Workbook is opened. The script is simply:\r\n\r\n    ActiveWorkbook.Connections(&quot;Query - Sample Query&quot;).Refresh\r\n\r\n**Concern/Issue:**\r\n\r\nFrom this, my Excel spreadsheets will have very updated data without needing human intervention. However, my concern is if there will be synchronization issues with the files i&#39;m connected to whenever I refresh the connection in Step 3. If the users are using the data files, is there a chance that a bug might occur and cause data loss such as corrupted files, conflicted copies, or any other bugs/problems?\r\n\r\nOne of the users claimed that the data they input this morning vanished. But I do not know if it&#39;s because of the fact that his assistant also used the file simultaneously, and perhaps he deleted the conflicted copy or if there was a problem with Dropbox not saving his file. It cannot be due to Step 1 because I did not use Step 1 on this case since it was already saved on the cloud to begin with. So i&#39;m wondering if my data connection could have anything to do with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/qxTuV.png",

            "body": "<p>So I have created a system at our office where I would use cloud computing systems (mainly Dropbox and Google Drive) to pull data daily. The system is as follows:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 1 (If the file is not in the clouds yet):</strong>\nThe relevant files (usually Excel and Access files) located at each User's desktop are automatically transferred to either Dropbox or Google Drive everyday at 4:30 pm by using a simple script and the Task Scheduler to automate the script activation. The folders where the files are saved on in Dropbox or Google Drive is shared to my account/employee account which will auto-sync on their computers. The script used is shown below:</p>\n\n<pre><code>xcopy \"C:\\Users\\Asus\\Desktop\\Test.MDB\" \"C:\\Users\\Asus\\Google Drive\" /Y /H /E /F /I\nexit\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> In my the Excel and/or Access files where I need the relevant files on, I will create a connection to link the files together. The image is shown below:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qxTuV.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qxTuV.png\" alt=\"Establishing a connection\"></a></p>\n\n<p>The connection string i'm using is an OLEDB connection string because my Access file is password protected. The string is shown below:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Provider=Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0;C:\\Users\\Asus\\Sample;Jet OLEDB:Database Password=\"abc123\";\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> I will then automatically refresh the data retrieved from the data connection by using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) that is activated whenever the Workbook is opened. The script is simply:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ActiveWorkbook.Connections(\"Query - Sample Query\").Refresh\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Concern/Issue:</strong></p>\n\n<p>From this, my Excel spreadsheets will have very updated data without needing human intervention. However, my concern is if there will be synchronization issues with the files i'm connected to whenever I refresh the connection in Step 3. If the users are using the data files, is there a chance that a bug might occur and cause data loss such as corrupted files, conflicted copies, or any other bugs/problems?</p>\n\n<p>One of the users claimed that the data they input this morning vanished.
