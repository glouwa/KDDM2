For instance, the output should be: \r\n\r\n`my_dict = {&#39;class 1&#39;: 45, &#39;class 2&#39;: 30}`. I made a previous examination of the dataset and realized that there is 500 different classes with different sum of values of course. My first though was using a dictionary for this purpose and don&#39;t know if is the best way to do so. What I did was create a dictionary for each line where there is a class but this way I have a lot of dictionaries some of them repeated.

            "body": "<p>This migh be very easy to implement but I can figure out a good implementation. I am trying to sum the values for different groups in a txt file. Let's say we have a file where each line is as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>------------------------\nBlank line\nclass 1 \nvalue 10\n------------------------\nBlank line\nclass 2\nvalue 20\n------------------------\nBlank line\nclass 1 \nvalue 15\n------------------------\nBlank line\nclass 1 \nvalue 20\n------------------------\nBlank line\nclass 2\nvalue 10\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I was thinking in create a dictionary setting the class as keys and sum of values for each key as dictionary value. For instance, the output should be: </p>\n\n<p><code>my_dict = {'class 1': 45, 'class 2': 30}</code>. I made a previous examination of the dataset and realized that there is 500 different classes with different sum of values of course. My first though was using a dictionary for this purpose and don't know if is the best way to do so. What I did was create a dictionary for each line where there is a class but this way I have a lot of dictionaries some of them repeated. But I could sum them by using <code>Counter fucntion from Collenctions</code> but definitely this is not the best way.\nAny suggestion?</p>\n"
