            "body": "<p>I have a nodejs site built using express which we are trying to optimise. We have a layout.html file with a {{{body}}} token and several other html files which are merged into layout.html at runtime by the express rendering engine.</p>\n\n<p>We would like to minify the html files as a post-build operation but it is failing because we have invalid markup in layout.html (the markup <em>is</em> valid after {{{body}}} has been replaced).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Developer A</strong>: Would like to fix the markup so we can minify post-build, partly because it makes working with the layout file easier in future, and partly because they believe we will get more of a performance benefit if we avoid the penalty of the web server CPU doing the minification at runtime.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Developer B</strong>: Says we should minify at runtime rather than fix the markup, and that we won't incur a penalty for doing so. They also believe minifying post-build will cause problems with express' rendering engine at runtime.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I don't know the tech well enough to know who is right and would welcome answers from experts in the field.</p>\n"

            "body": "<p>Say I want to use a macro that prepends <code>\\x</code> to it's argument so that the replacement is a valid hex escape sequence, something like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#define HEXIFY(s) \"\\x\" s\n...\n\nstd::cout &lt;&lt; HEFIXY(\"48\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Or:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#define HEXIFY(s) \"\\x\" #s\n...\n\nstd::cout &lt;&lt; HEXIFY(48);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Which would print the character <code>H</code> (hex 48).</p>\n\n<p>Both of these snippets don't seem to work however. Is there a way I can accomplish this by only using macros?</p>\n"
