Have a pretty weird issue where My marker is being set by akka-http but slf4j is not able to pick up the marker and segregate it into the correct log file.\r\nMy role of log123 is more of logging access logs. Somehow my logs are getting into STDOUT that too in the incorrect format.\r\nI am assuming that the marker is somehow not being picked up by slf4j to look for a logger instance.  ANy pointers would be greatly appreciated\r\nMy logback.xml looks like:\r\n\r\n     &lt;appender name=&quot;STDOUT&quot; class=&quot;ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender&quot;&gt;\r\n          &lt;encoder&gt;\r\n            &lt;pattern&gt;%-5level - %msg%n&lt;/pattern&gt;\r\n          &lt;/encoder&gt;\r\n     &lt;/appender&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;appender name=&quot;log123&quot; class=&quot;ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.RollingFileAppender&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;file&gt;logs/log123&lt;/file&gt;\r\n        &lt;append&gt;true&lt;/append&gt;\r\n        &lt;rollingPolicy class=&quot;ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.TimeBasedRollingPolicy&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;fileNamePattern&gt;logs/log123-%d.log.gz&lt;/fileNamePattern&gt;\r\n            &lt;maxHistory&gt;7&lt;/maxHistory&gt;\r\n        &lt;/rollingPolicy&gt;\r\n        &lt;encoder&gt;\r\n            &lt;pattern&gt;%msg%n&lt;/pattern&gt;\r\n        &lt;/encoder&gt;\r\n    &lt;/appender&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n    &lt;logger name=&quot;log123&quot; level=&quot;INFO&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;appender-ref ref=&quot;log123&quot; /&gt;\r\n    &lt;/logger&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n    &lt;root level=&quot;INFO&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;appender-ref ref=&quot;STDOUT&quot; /&gt;\r\n    &lt;/root&gt;",
