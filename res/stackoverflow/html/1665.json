I read that the variables that are exposed to cython through an extern statement are not the same for every module. For example, you cant manipulate a int in one module and see the changed int in an other module.\nI think this is the reason for my segmentation faults.</p>\n\n<p>Here is my real world example:</p>\n\n<p>Get the jrtk repo under <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/stueker/jrtk/src/master/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://bitbucket.org/stueker/jrtk/src/master/</a>. \nI link against the a library that is created when you build the project with following terminal commands:</p>\n\n<pre><code>mkdir build\ncmake ..\nmake\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I placed the following files in an folder next to the repo.</p>\n\n<p><strong>setup.py</strong>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>from distutils.core import setup\nfrom Cython.Build import cythonize\nfrom distutils.extension import Extension\nimport os\nimport shutil\nimport subprocess\nimport sys\n\n\ndef find_tcl():\n    build_path = \"build\"\n    try:\n        os.mkdir(build_path)\n    except FileExistsError:\n        print(\"build already exists\")\n\n    cmake_cache = \"CMakeCache.txt\"\n    tcl_include = \"TCL_INCLUDE_PATH\"\n    separator = \":PATH=\"\n\n    if sys.platform.startswith('win'):\n        shell = True\n    else:\n        shell = False\n    cmake_cmd = [\"cmake\", \"..\"]\n\n    print(\"################### Calling CMAKE ###################\")\n    retCode = subprocess.check_call(cmake_cmd, cwd=build_path, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT, shell=shell)\n    print(\"################### CMAKE returned ###################\")\n\n    text = open(os.path.join(build_path, cmake_cache)).read()\n    start = text.find(tcl_include)\n\n    include_path = text[start:text.find(os.linesep, start)]\n    return include_path.replace(tcl_include, \"\").replace(separator, \"\").strip()\n\njrtk_root = \"/home/simon/janus/jrtk\"\n\ndef declare_cython_extensions(source_path):\n    libs = [\"janus\"]\n    lib_dirs = [jrtk_root + os.path.sep + \"build\"]\n\n    postfix = \"/include\"\n    base_dir = jrtk_root + os.path.sep + \"source\"\n    (path, dirs, _) = next(os.walk(base_dir))\n    include_dirs = [os.path.join(path, d) + postfix for d in dirs]\n    include_dirs.extend([base_dir, find_tcl()])\n\n    extension_list = []\n    for (path, folders, files) in os.walk(source_path):\n        for f in files:\n            if f.endswith(\".pyx\"):\n                ext = Extension(f.replace(\".pyx\", \"\"),\n                                [os.path.join(path, f)],\n                                libraries=libs,\n                                library_dirs=lib_dirs,\n                                include_dirs=include_dirs,\n                                define_macros=[(\"DISABLE_TK\", None),\n                                               (\"DISABLE_READLINE\", None),\n                                               #

While lxml gives me an attribute dictionary with <code>xlinx:href</code> it chokes on passing this to <code>makeelement</code> is there an elegant solution?</li>\n<li>Should I use <code>lxml</code> or is there something better (more straight forward)? My goal is to rewrite <code>image</code> tags to <code>use</code> tags and embed the content of the referenced svgs in symbols. (So far <code>lxml</code> and the issues I had with namespaces seem repulsive).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>.</p>\n\n<pre><code>from lxml import etree\n\ndef inlineSvg(path):\n    parser = etree.XMLParser(recover=True)\n    tree = etree.parse(path, parser)\n\n    root = tree.getroot()\n    print(root.nsmap)\n\n\n    for img in tree.iter('{http://www.w3.org/2000/svg}image'):\n    #for img in tree.iterfind('image', root.nsmap): #for some reason I can't get this to work...\n        print(img)\n\n        #we have to translate xlink: to {http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink} for it to work, despit the lib returning xlink: ...\n        settableAttributes = dict(img.items()) #img.attribute\n        settableAttributes['{http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink}href'] = settableAttributes['xlink:href']\n        del settableAttributes['xlink:href']\n\n        print(etree.tostring(img.makeelement('use', settableAttributes)))\n</code></pre>\n"
