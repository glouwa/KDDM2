            "body": "<p>For background I'm using react, redux, react-router(v4), react-cognito, and appsync. My application uses <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/rcanepa/b4ce0dff8d85b357504e04b03e69ac66\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">PrivateRoute</a> to ensure the user has authorization for each route requested. react-cognito handles all the authentication for me and stores JWT tokens, Federated Identity temporary IAM access key / secret access key / session token in the redux store. </p>\n\n<p>The AppSync tutorial assumes you are using AWS-amplify instead of react-cognito, and places the <code>&lt;ApolloProvider client = {this.client}&gt;</code> at root application level, where </p>\n\n<pre><code>this.client = new AWSAppSyncClient({\n      url: AppSync.graphqlEndpoint,\n      region: AppSync.region,\n      auth: {\n\n        // Amazon Cognito Federated Identities using AWS Amplify\n        //credentials: () =&gt; Auth.currentCredentials(),\n\n        // Amazon Cognito user pools using AWS Amplify\n        // type: AUTH_TYPE.AMAZON_COGNITO_USER_POOLS,\n        // jwtToken: async () =&gt; (await Auth.currentSession()).getIdToken().getJwtToken(),\n      },\n      disableOffline: true\n    });\n  }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In my case, at root component mounting there is nothing in the store yet from react-cognito (half my SPA is public requiring no authentication) and I'm not sure what async function could be called at mount to pull this once available as seems to be done in the example above. </p>\n\n<p>For the time being I've solved this by putting ApolloProvider at the component level, only for components that need it and that exist in PrivateRoutes (hence will have credential info available in the store), but this leads to code duplication and feels wrong.</p>\n\n<p>Short of migrating to aws-amplify, any suggestions how to refactor this?</p>\n"
