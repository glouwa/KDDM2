            "body": "<p>First I want to say that I'm really new to html, I started learning it one week ago or so, and I know that I can add scripts with VBScript (good with it) or Javascript (quite good with it...).</p>\n\n<p>I decided to try to write a piece of code myself then auto cut and paste with some other parts and then save all via javascript (more specifically: upload a png image > continue only if it's 64x64 bits large > copy a rectangle of 4x4 at specific coordinates > paste it into a new image of 64x64 bits  at a specific coordinate > resize that cut part of 200% without mipmapping > saving as png).</p>\n\n<p>I've made a lot of tries, but every single thing doesn't want to work :(, and internet says only that I can use some external programs but I would like not to make a web page, but only a simple help page + troubleshooting offline in html (so no external programs), the only thing at the moment I can do is rotating an uploaded image and saving it. Please, can anyone help me? I really need it.</p>\n\n<p>Sorry that I ask it here, but I don't write a lot on forums for programming questions, because I can answer myself looking in my books or on the internet.\nThanks in advance to all for the help!</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:\nlink where I found the idea code <a href=\"https://code.sololearn.com/W9k6AOgpeJ6z/?ref=app\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://code.sololearn.com/W9k6AOgpeJ6z/?ref=app</a></p>\n"

Then, the Manufacturer produces a different product based on the same raw material from the Supplier. At this point, the Manufacturer has their own product, units, batch, and so forth. For example, from that 1000 lbs shipment, the Manufacturer may produce 5 different products in different sized batches with different units. Then, the Manufacturer ships 2 of those products to two different Distributors, who then can take that and further break it down into different batches and units, which they then ship to their Retailers. Basically, the process is the same through out the entire supply chain, where the previous party provides something that gets broken down and transformed by the recieving participant.\r\n\r\nTo me, it seems like there will need to be many blocks that all &quot;relate&quot; to each other, based on some parent/child relationship or dependency. For example, the supplier would be the first block/parent. Then the manufacturer can have X number of blocks/children that are dependent on that block, and so forth.\r\n\r\nAm I seeing or conceptualizing this wrong? Is there a better way?
