            "body": "<p>I am trying to add the example external kernel module <em>hello-mod</em> from <em>meta-skeleton/recipes-kernel</em> to my image using the Yocto build system. When I try to compile it with <code>bitbake hello-mod</code>, however, it fails at a second stage complaining that <code>struct module</code> has no member named <code>name</code> on the line <code>.name = KBUILD_MODNAME,</code>. It seems as if <code>struct module</code> is not being defined even though <em>linux/module.h</em> has been included. This is the generic module code that doesn't seem to compile:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#include &lt;linux/module.h&gt;\n#include &lt;linux/vermagic.h&gt;\n#include &lt;linux/compiler.h&gt;\n\nMODULE_INFO(vermagic, VERMAGIC_STRING);\nMODULE_INFO(name, KBUILD_MODNAME);\n\n__visible struct module __this_module\n__attribute__((section(\".gnu.linkonce.this_module\"))) = {\n    .name = KBUILD_MODNAME,\n    .init = init_module,\n#ifdef CONFIG_MODULE_UNLOAD\n    .exit = cleanup_module,\n#endif\n    .arch = MODULE_ARCH_INIT,\n};\n\n#ifdef RETPOLINE\nMODULE_INFO(retpoline, \"Y\");\n#endif\n\nstatic const char __module_depends[]\n__used\n__attribute__((section(\".modinfo\"))) =\n\"depends=\";\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I am unable to see anything wrong in the compilation log, make is being invoked (correctly, to the best of knowledge) with the following line:</p>\n\n<pre><code>make -C /path/to/poky-rocko/build/tmp/work-shared/duovero/kernel-source \\ \nM=/path/to/poky-rocko/build/tmp/work/duovero-poky-linux-gnueabi/hello-mod/0.1-r0\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and I can confirm that <em>module.h</em> exists in the directory:\n<em>/path/to/poky-rocko/build/tmp/work-shared/duovero/kernel-source/include/linux</em></p>\n\n<p>So I am running out of and looking for ideas on how to debug this issue. For the record, these are the current versions of the layers, kernel etc:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>poky is 9915e071bcadd7c4d5363a067c529889851d37a5 (rocko) from git.yoctoproject.org</li>\n<li>linux is 9dc30ff9a115559cc55673d0b1d3c576402d073e from git.kernel.org</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Any help or hints would really be appreciated!</p>\n"
