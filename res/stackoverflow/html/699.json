I have a program that works fine when I run it on terminal:</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"python ./solution/program1.py ./data/set.data 15 123 output-1.txt\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here     </p>\n\n<pre><code>program1.py - program name\nset.data    - input data set\n15          -  input program parameter\n123         - input program parameter\noutput-1.txt- output file\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The output file is generated for the program.</p>\n\n<p>I have a pytest that checks my results. This doesn't work with pytest. \nWhen I run pytest, there is no output, the pytest keeps on running without any results. I have to manually stop it. Is there any way I could fix it?</p>\n\n<p>Pytest:</p>\n\n<pre><code>import subprocess, os\n\ndef test_kmeans():\n    file_name = \"output-1.txt\"\n    command=\"python ./solution/program1.py ./data/set.data 15 123 {}\".format(file_name)\n    process = subprocess.Popen(command, shell=True,stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)\n    code=process.wait()\n    assert(not code), \"Command failed\"\n    assert(open(file_name,\"r\").read()==open(\"tests/final-results.txt\",\"r\").read())\n</code></pre>\n"

In timeslots (horario) table there are 336 rows (all possible time slots) so it should not take that long to perform the RIGHT JOIN.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The explain plan says that first it does an ALL access to timeslots, and after that all the other tables are accessed via INDEX.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So I wanted to change the access order to tables, forcing to access timeslots at the end. I changed the order in the FROM clause changing the JOIN to RIGHT, but the explain plan says the same (and the time to run the query is still 5 sec).</p>\n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Testing things, I have tried to do a STRAIGHT_JOIN to force the table access order and it works, cause it took less than a second to return the rows (probably because it is a join, but it is still significantly faster). But I cannot use STRAIGHT_JOIN cause I need the RIGHT JOIN, and I've read that there is no way to do STRAIGHT in an OUTER JOIN.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The explain plan of the execution with straight join is the following:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/CpKek.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">explain plan with straight_join</a></p>\n\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>I have tried to create a view but the result was the same.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So,</p>\n\n<p>a) can I force somehow the optimizer to access the timeslots table the last one?</p>\n\n<p>b) but the question is why it is taking so long, if there are only 336 rows to do a RIGHT JOIN with (150 rows of busy slots).... Maybe this could help me to rewrite the query.</p>\n\n<p>Many thanks in advance for any hint... Meanwhile I'm rewriting the query again and again.... :)</p>\n\n<p>Xavi.</p>\n"
