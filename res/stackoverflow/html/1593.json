One is what I call an <code>oriented_cell</code> class and the other is a <code>vertex</code> class. Both are currently templated with the following forward declarations:</p>\n\n<pre><code>/* Forward declaration for the oriented cell class */\ntemplate&lt;\n   typename data_t,\n   typename container,\n   typename id_t   = uint32_t,\n   typename num_t  = double &gt;\nclass oriented_cell;\n\n/* Forward declaration for vertex class */\ntemplate&lt;\n   int dim = 4,\n   typename id_t = uint32_t,\n   typename num_t  = double &gt;\nclass vertex;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Both of these templated classes require storing pointers to the other class such that I will end up with a type of graph data structure I can traverse. The sort of thing I am after is something along the lines of:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// templated vertex class\ntemplate&lt;\n   int dim = 4,\n   typename id_t = uint32_t,\n   typename num_t  = double &gt;\nclass vertex {\npublic:\n   /* ctors/dtors and public methods */\nprivate:\n   std::set&lt; oriented_cell&lt;...&gt;* &gt; incident_cells;\n};\n\n// templated oriented cell class\ntemplate&lt;\n   typename data_t,\n   typename container,\n   typename id_t   = uint32_t,\n   typename num_t  = double &gt;\nclass oriented_cell {\npublic:\n   /* ctors/dtors and public methods */\nprivate:\n   std::set&lt; vertex&lt;...&gt;* &gt; vertices;\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>where <code>vertex&lt;...&gt;</code> and <code>oriented_cell&lt;...&gt;</code> correspond to arbitrary templated types of a <code>vertex</code> and <code>oriented_cell</code> class. </p>\n\n<p>Is this feasible? If so, how? I am not able to see how to implement this when the classes that are coupled on each other are templated. </p>\n\n<p>If this is not feasible as-is, is there something more elegant that achieves the desired result without resorting to making the two classes based on some shared base class that acts as a graph node that can store connectivity info?</p>\n"
