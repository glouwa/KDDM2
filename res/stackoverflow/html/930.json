However, I'm stuck on trying to upload the view in React with the newly updated photo.</p>\n\n<p>If they're a new user, by default the photo will have a default picture (simple blank avatar). When they want to upload a new photo it'll upload the filename into the database specific to the userName of the user. </p>\n\n<p>What I'm stuck on is figuring out how to keep the updated photo that the user uploaded in view. I managed to update the record in mysql.</p>\n\n<p>Here is my code:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Model:</strong></p>\n\n<p><div class=\"snippet\" data-lang=\"js\" data-hide=\"false\" data-console=\"true\" data-babel=\"false\">\r\n<div class=\"snippet-code\">\r\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>var db = require('../dbconnection');\r\n\r\nvar profilePage = {\r\n    updatePhoto: function(data, callback){\r\n        db.query('UPDATE users set profilePic=\"'+data.profilePic+'\" WHERE userName=\"'+data.userName+'\"', callback)\r\n    },\r\n}\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = profilePage;</code></pre>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Route</strong></p>\n\n<p><div class=\"snippet\" data-lang=\"js\" data-hide=\"false\" data-console=\"true\" data-babel=\"false\">\r\n<div class=\"snippet-code\">\r\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>var express = require('express');\r\nvar router = express.Router();\r\nvar Profile = require('../models/Profilepage');\r\n\r\nrouter.post('/updatePhoto', function(req, res){\r\n    Profile.updatePhoto(req.body, function(err, rows) {\r\n        if(err) {\r\n            res.json(err);\r\n        } else {\r\n            res.json(rows);\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n});\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = router;</code></pre>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>View</strong></p>\n\n<p><div class=\"snippet\" data-lang=\"js\" data-hide=\"false\" data-console=\"true\" data-babel=\"false\">\r\n<div class=\"snippet-code\">\r\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>import React from 'react';\r\n\r\nimport Header from '../common/Header';\r\nimport { Modal, Button } from 'react-bootstrap';\r\nimport profileService from '../../services/Profilepage';\r\n\r\nclass Profilepage extends React.Component {\r\n    constructor(props){\r\n        super(props);\r\n\r\n        this.handleClose = this.handleClose.bind(this);\r\n        this.handleShow = this.handleShow.bind(this);\r\n\r\n        this.state = {\r\n            firstName: '',\r\n            lastName: '',\r\n            email: '',\r\n            userName: '',\r\n            profilePic: 'defaultpic.png',\r\n            newprofilePic: '',\r\n            errorMsg: false,\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    async userStatus(){\r\n        const userObject = await JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('userData'));\r\n\r\n        this.setState({\r\n            firstName: userObject.firstName,\r\n            lastName: userObject.lastName,\r\n            email: userObject.email,\r\n            userName: userObject.userName\r\n        })\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    handleClose(){\r\n        this.setState({\r\n            show:false,\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    handleShow(){\r\n        this.setState({\r\n            show:true\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    fileChangedHandler(e){\r\n        this.setState({\r\n            profilePic: e.target.files[0].name\r\n        })\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    async onSubmit(e){\r\n        e.preventDefault();\r\n\r\n        console.log(this.state);\r\n\r\n        const data = {\r\n            profilePic: this.state.profilePic,\r\n            userName: this.state.userName\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        // Check if a uploaded photo was taken.\r\n        if(this.state.profilePic === ''){\r\n            this.setState({\r\n                errorMsg: true\r\n            })\r\n        } else {\r\n            // Update the photo.\r\n            const profileData = await profileService.updatePhoto(data)\r\n\r\n            console.log(this.state);\r\n            console.log(profileData);\r\n\r\n            if(profileData.affectedRows === 1) {\r\n                this.setState({\r\n                    profilePic: 'newpic.png'\r\n                })\r\n            }\r\n            //console.log(this.state.profilePic);\r\n            //location.href='/Profilepage'\r\n        }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    async componentDidMount(){\r\n        await this.userStatus();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    render(){\r\n        return (\r\n            &lt;div className=\"container\"&gt;\r\n                &lt;Header /&gt;\r\n                &lt;div className=\"row\"&gt;\r\n                    &lt;div className=\"col-md-5\" id=\"profile-left\"&gt;\r\n                        &lt;h1&gt;Welcome, {this.state.userName}&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n\r\n                        &lt;div className=\"img-rounded\"&gt;\r\n                        // This ternary operator doesn't work.
