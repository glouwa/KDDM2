Maybe you can help me out?!\r\n\r\n**Message duplicates:** It seems that the PubSub service in each instance (Python script inside the docker container within compute engine) reads a batch of messages (~10) in somewhat like a buffer and gives them to my code. Looks like all instances that spin up at the same time will read all the same messages (the first 10 of 2.000) and will start working on the same stuff. In my logs I see that most messages are processed 3 times by different machines. I was expecting that PubSub knows if some subscriber buffered 10 messages so that another subscriber will buffer 10 different messages and not the same ones.\r\n\r\n**Acknowledgement deadline:** Because of the buffering the messages that come in the end of the buffer (let&#39;s say message 8 or 9) had to wait in the buffer until the preceding messages (messages 1 to 7) have been processed. The sum of that waiting time plus its own processing time may run into the timeout of 600sec.\r\n\r\n**Load-Balancing:** Because each machine buffers so many messages, the load is consumed by just a few instances while other instances are completely idle. This happens for the scaling-option two that uses the PubSub stackdriver metric.\r\n\r\nPeople told me that I need to implement a manual synchronization service using Cloud SQL or something else in which each instance indicates on which message it is working, so that other instances won&#39;t start the same. But I feel that can&#39;t be true - because then I don&#39;t get the idea what PubSub is all about. \r\n\r\n[![pubsub behavior][5]][5]\r\n\r\n\r\n**Update:** I found a [nice explanation by Gregor Hohpe][3], co-author of the book Enterprise Integration Patterns from 2015. Actually my observation was wrong, but the observed side effects are real.\r\n \r\n&gt; Google Cloud Pub/Sub API actually implements both the\r\n&gt; Publish-Subscribe Channel and the Competing Consumers patterns. At the\r\n&gt; heart of the Cloud Pub/Sub is a classic Publish-Subscribe Channel,\r\n&gt; which delivers a single message published to it to multiple\r\n&gt; subscribers. One advantage of this pattern is that adding subscribers\r\n&gt; is side-effect free, which is one reason a Publish-Subscribe Channel\r\n&gt; is sometimes considered more loosely coupled than a Point-to-Point\r\n&gt; Channel, which delivers a message to exactly one subscriber. Adding\r\n&gt; consumers to a Point-to-Point Channel results in Competing Consumers\r\n&gt; and thus has a strong side effect.\r\n\r\n[![Copyright: Gregor Hohpe, co-author of the book Enterprise Integration Patterns. 2015.][4]][4]\r\n\r\nThe side effects I observed are about the message buffering and message flow control in each of the subscribers (who subscribed to the same subscription, point-to-point == competing consumers). The current version of the Python Client Lib wraps the PubSub REST API (and RPCs). If that wrapper is used, there is no control on:\r\n\r\n - How many containers are started on one VM; Multiple containers may be started if the CPU is not yet fully utilized\r\n - How many messages are pulled from the subscription at once (buffering); no control at all\r\n - How many threads, for processing the pulled messages, are started inside on container; flow_control(max_messages) has no effect if the value is below a fixed value. \r\n\r\nThe side effects we observed are:\r\n\r\n 1. One consumer pulls a high number of messages at once (approximately 100 to 1.000) and queues them in its client buffer. Therefore all other VM&#39;s that are started according to the auto-scaling rule, do not receive any message, because all messages are in the queue of the first few VM&#39;s\r\n 2. Messages are re-delivered either to the same VM or any other VM (or docker container) if it runs into the acknowledgement deadline. Therefore you need to modify the acknowledgement deadline while processing the message. The deadline counter starts when the processing starts.\r\n 3. Assuming that the processing of the message is a long running task (for instance machine learning), you may\r\n - Acknowledge the message upfront, but this will cause the VM to be shut down by the auto-scaling rule if there is no further message waiting. The rule does not care if the CPU utilization is still strong and the processing has not yet been finished.\r\n - Acknowledge the message after processing. In this case you need to modify the acknowledgement deadline of that specific message while processing that message. There must not be one single code block that breaks the deadline since the last modification.\r\n\r\nPossible solutions that haven&#39;t been looked into:\r\n\r\n - Using the Java Client Library since it comes with better controls on pulling and consuming messages\r\n - Using the underlying API calls and classes of the Python Client Library \r\n - Building a synchronization storage that orchestrates the competing consumers\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/alpha/compute/instances/create-with-container\r\n  [2]: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/autoscaler/?hl=de&amp;_ga=2.101834881.-1281645554.1517998144#autoscaling_options\r\n  [3]: http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/ramblings/82_googlepubsub.html\r\n  [4]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/d5nOy.png\r\n  [5]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/HqoEt.png",

I&#39;m really looking for a top-level comparison that wouldn&#39;t take all that into account. Just like a literal comparison tool can easily ignore blank lines and comments.\r\n\r\nHere is an example:\r\n\r\n1:\r\n\r\n    static void main()\r\n    {\r\n        string i = &quot;Hello World!&quot;;\r\n        Console.Write(i);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n2:\r\n\r\n    static void main()\r\n    {\r\n        string helloWorldString = &quot;Hello World!&quot;;\r\n        Console.Write(helloWorldString);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n3:\r\n\r\n    static void main()\r\n    {\r\n        string myString = &quot;Hello World!&quot;;\r\n        WriteToConsole(myString);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    static void WriteToConsole(string text)\r\n    {\r\n        Console.Write(text);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThose 3 examples of simple Hello World programs **should** behave the same, at least from the user&#39;s point of view, extreme system configuration edge cases not included.

I wouldn&#39;t expect such a tool to be perfect, especially when the project has multiple classes, forms, global variables, etc.\r\n\r\nBut when doing some refactoring, getting a quick heads up like &quot;With your changes, a behaviour has changed even though you hadn&#39;t noticed&quot; or &quot;The behaviour before and after your change stayed the same&quot; would go a long way when it comes to saving time.\r\n\r\nIs there such a tool in Visual Studio, Resharper, or available somewhere else?\r\n\r\nAs an extra exercise because I&#39;m curious, if it doesn&#39;t exist for C#, does it exist for other languages?
