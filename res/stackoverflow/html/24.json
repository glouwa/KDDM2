I have a model with several fields, a few of which are calculated fields. </p>\n\n<p>Sorting and Filtering with the MVC grid works really well, even with > 550,000 records. However, when I am trying to sort and filter on one of the calculated fields, there is a great decrease in performance (it takes about 45 seconds). This isn't the end of the world, but I would like to know if there is a way to increase the performance of calculated fields? </p>\n\n<p>I am pretty sure that the performance drop is either due to the lack of an index on the calculated fields, or the fact that each record's calculated property is re-calculated and <em>then</em> sorted/filtered, or both.</p>\n\n<p>If anyone has any insight on where the bottleneck could be and if there was a way I could increase performance, it would be greatly appreciated. </p>\n"

            "body_markdown": "I am writing a C++ program that solves a PDE and saves the solution in a 2D array. Then it does something with the results of this PDE. However, solving the PDE accurately takes a lot of computations. Thus, the solving part has to be executed only once, but the results should be saved, such that I can get back to them later. \r\n\r\nTherefore, I wrote two different codes: \r\n\r\n1. solves the pde and saves results in matrix A. Matrix A is saved in a binary file. \r\n\r\n2. Reads the values in the binary file and does computations with the results. \r\n\r\nHowever, when I read the binary file in the second code, it only an empty array and does not contain the values that I saved here in the other code. \r\n\r\nIf I read it in code 1, it does function as desired. \r\n\r\nWhat am I doing wrong? Is it even possible to read the values of a binary file in an other application? Should I approach this problem completely different? \r\n\r\nI saved both codes in a different project, should I somehow link them? Or should both codes be in the same project? \r\n\r\nI spend a few days searching the web for a solution, but I only find questions and answers on how to open and save binary files within the same code (for instance [this][1] and [this][2]).
