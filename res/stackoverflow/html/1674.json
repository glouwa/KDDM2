Then, based on their user groups, they would see certain information. I have tried the node package <a href=\"https://github.com/auth0/passport-windowsauth\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">passport-windowsauth</a>, but I am not able to authenticate, possibly because I don't know what the <strong>bindDN</strong> or <strong>bindCredentials</strong> are. I have also tried <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sspi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">node-sspi</a>, and had better luck with this, but the issue with this is that it's only server-side, and as far as I can tell, I can't create a form that would then allow the user to authenticate from the client side.

            "body": "<p>I'd like to create a custom Python decorator that will 1) check the value of a class attribute <code>my_attribute</code> before running the function, and 2) turn the class method into a property. I can achieve this as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>def my_decorator(f):\n    def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        if self.my_attribute is None:\n            raise ValueError('No location set to model.')\n\n        return f(self, *args, **kwargs)\n    return wrapper\n\nclass MyClass:\n    my_attribute = None\n\n    @property\n    @my_decorator\n    def my_method():\n        return self. my_attribute\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I'd like to know how I can edit the definition of <code>my_decorator</code> so that it makes the wrapped method a property. Essentially I'd like to avoid the use of <code>@property</code> and <code>@my_decorator</code> for each method, letting me write the class definition as</p>\n\n<pre><code>class MyClass:\n    my_attribute = None\n\n    @my_new_decorator\n    def my_method():\n        return self. my_attribute\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I've looked up the declaration of the builtin <code>@property</code> decorator, but its defined as a class and wasn't much help.</p>\n\n<p>Any suggestions?</p>\n"

I believe it may be a problem with the configuration of the development environment as yet I have not found anything different from the machine that works, any help is greatly appreciated. Details - development environment is VS2013 professional \r\n\r\nCode sample - here is the call statement from ascx page inside a function\r\n**SearchFilters.Region_Changed(strSelected, fillCCLB);**\r\n\r\nThis is the method on the code behind page that is being called\r\n**[Ajax.AjaxMethod()]\r\npublic DataSet Region_Changed(string rgnList)**\r\n\r\nSince I am not an AJAX guru, I do not understand how my machine is calling this method as it seems it is passing two parameters to a method that accepts only one.

            "body": "<p>I have an AJAX method that works fine on my development machine, yet a fellow developer's machine will not call the method, we are using the same code from a common repository and I have compared the code to make sure they had not changed anything that would affect that and everything is good there. I believe it may be a problem with the configuration of the development environment as yet I have not found anything different from the machine that works, any help is greatly appreciated. Details - development environment is VS2013 professional </p>\n\n<p>Code sample - here is the call statement from ascx page inside a function\n<strong>SearchFilters.Region_Changed(strSelected, fillCCLB);</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is the method on the code behind page that is being called\n<strong>[Ajax.AjaxMethod()]\npublic DataSet Region_Changed(string rgnList)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Since I am not an AJAX guru, I do not understand how my machine is calling this method as it seems it is passing two parameters to a method that accepts only one. The second parameter is actually another function inside the ascx page. I know this is the calling statement as I put a literal string in place of strSelected and the was passed to the Region_Changed method. On the machine with the problem it seems that the code works fine up to that point and then it apparently exits the function early, though no errors are reported. This is a webforms application.</p>\n\n<p>Calling function code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function populateCCListBox() {\n    // Steps taken here:\n    //  1. Check if \"ANY\" region is selected.

If an entry is selected, put it in a comma seperated list.\n    //  4. Call server side method with this comma seperated list.\n    //      \n    var regionLB = document.getElementById('&lt;%= RegionLB.ClientID %&gt;');\n    var strSelected = \"\";\n\n    // If the user has not selected any option, treat this as \"ANY\" selected\n    if (regionLB.selectedIndex == -1) {\n        strSelected = \"ANY,\";\n    }\n    else {\n        for (var i = 0; i &lt; regionLB.options.length; i++) {\n            if (regionLB.options[i].selected == true) {\n                // alert(regionLB.options[i].text);\n                if (regionLB.options[i].text == \"ANY\") {\n                    strSelected = \"ANY,\";\n                    break;\n                }\n                else {\n                    strSelected = strSelected + \"'\" + regionLB.options[i].text + \"'\" + \",\";\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Remove the trailing comma\n    strSelected = strSelected.substring(0, strSelected.length - 1);\n    //alert(strSelected);\n    if (strSelected == \"ANY\" | strSelected == \"\") {\n        document.getElementById('&lt;%= hdnReg.ClientID %&gt;').value = \"\";\n    }\n    else {\n        document.getElementById('&lt;%= hdnReg.ClientID %&gt;').value = \"(\" + strSelected + \")\";\n    }\n\n    //alert(\"Hidden Region : \" + document.getElementById(\"SearchFilters1_hdnReg\").value);\n\n    //The call that is not happening\n    SearchFilters.Region_Changed(strSelected, fillCCLB);\n    ccLB = document.getElementById('&lt;%= CcLB.ClientID %&gt;');\n    ccLB.focus();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The called function's code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Ajax.AjaxMethod()]\n    public DataSet Region_Changed(string rgnList)\n        {\n        // The method takes a comma seperated list of regions. \n        // Steps taken here:\n        //  1.
