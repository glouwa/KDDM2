The error printed in the stack trace doesn&#39;t appear to correspond at all with what I&#39;m seeing in the source code.\r\n\r\n**Edit (Resolution):**\r\n\r\nThe accepted answer was spot on. I had written another test class, and decided to simply add in a stub for the `__init__` method:\r\n\r\n    class MyUnfinishedTest(BaseTest):\r\n    \r\n        def __init__():\r\n            pass\r\n\r\nThen I had forgotten about it and worked on other stuff, and ran the tests.

Odd numbers are getting printed as even and even ones are getting printed as odd  sometimes.  I am guessing my use of condition variable is not correct. However, I am not able to figure out the exact cause. There are no compilation errors just the wrong output. </p>\n\n<p>There are some links out there to print odd and even numbers\n<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29455170/c-threads-to-print-sequence-of-numbers-with-even-and-odd-number-printing-threa\">C Threads to print sequence of numbers : with even and odd number printing threads running parallely</a></p>\n\n<p>It has to print from an array and I tried to build my logic using the same but that is not giving me the correct output.  </p>\n\n<p>The command for compilation is \ngcc multithreading.c -lpthread -o m.out</p>\n\n<pre><code>#include &lt;pthread.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;\n#include &lt;time.h&gt;\n\npthread_mutex_t count_mutex = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;\npthread_cond_t condition_var = PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER;\nvoid *print_even();\nvoid *print_odd();\nint count = 0;\nint size = 0;\n\nint main(int argc, char *argv[])\n{\n  if(argc &lt; 1)\n    exit(0);\n\n  //initialize an array of the integers to be passed\n  int numSize = atoi(argv[1]); \n  srand(time(NULL));\n  int *nums = (int*)malloc((numSize - 1)*sizeof(int));\n  int i ;\n  for(i = 0; i &lt; numSize ; i++)\n  {\n    nums[i] = (rand() % 100) + i ;\n    printf(\"%d   \" , nums[i]);\n    size++;\n  }\n  printf(\"\\n\");\n\n  pthread_t even_thread;\n  pthread_t odd_thread;\n  pthread_create(&amp;even_thread, NULL, print_even , (void*)nums);\n  pthread_create(&amp;odd_thread, NULL, print_odd, (void*)nums);\n\n\n  pthread_join(even_thread, NULL); \n  pthread_join(odd_thread, NULL);\n  pthread_mutex_destroy(&amp;count_mutex);\n  pthread_cond_destroy(&amp;condition_var);\n  free(nums);\n\n  return 0;\n\n}\n\n\n// Print odd numbers\nvoid *print_odd(void *arg)\n{\n  int *arr_p = (int *)arg;\n  while(count &lt; size)\n  {\n    // Lock mutex and then wait for signal to relase mutex\n    pthread_mutex_lock( &amp;count_mutex );\n    while( arr_p[count] % 2 != 0 ) \n    { \n            pthread_cond_wait( &amp;condition_var, &amp;count_mutex );\n    }\n    count++;\n    printf(\"Array value print_odd: %d\\n\",arr_p[count]);\n    pthread_mutex_unlock( &amp;count_mutex );\n    pthread_cond_signal( &amp;condition_var );\n  }\n  pthread_exit(0);\n}\n\n\n\n// print even numbers\nvoid *print_even(void *arg)\n{\n  int *arr_p = (int*)arg;\n  while(count &lt; size)\n  {\n     // Lock mutex and then wait for signal to relase mutex\n    pthread_mutex_lock( &amp;count_mutex );\n    while( arr_p[count] % 2 == 0 )\n    {\n            pthread_cond_wait( &amp;condition_var, &amp;count_mutex );\n    }\n    count++;\n    printf(\"Array Value print_even: %d\\n\", arr_p[count]);\n    pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;count_mutex);\n    pthread_cond_signal( &amp;condition_var );\n  }\n  pthread_exit(0);\n}\n\n\noutput: \n2   62   61   20   91   28   63   74   30   13   64   69   64   108   105   \nArray value print_odd: 62\nArray value print_odd: 61\nArray Value print_even: 20\nArray value print_odd: 91\nArray Value print_even: 28\nArray value print_odd: 63\nArray Value print_even: 74\nArray value print_odd: 30\nArray value print_odd: 13\nArray Value print_even: 64\nArray value print_odd: 69\nArray Value print_even: 64\nArray value print_odd: 108\nArray value print_odd: 105\nArray Value print_even: 0\nArray value print_odd: 538976306\n</code></pre>\n"
