Each of those tags might contain even more child tags, like &quot;Allowance&quot; will have &quot;Yearly allowance&quot;, &quot;Monthly allowance&quot; and &quot;Daily allowance&quot;. \r\n\r\nEach of these child tags will contain a reference (I&#39;m doing this in Java by the way, meaning pointer arithmetic is not allowed) to other child tags before and after it, like &quot;Monthly allowance&quot; will have `previousSibling` point to &quot;Yearly allowance&quot; and `nextSibling` point to &quot;Daily allowance&quot;.\r\n\r\nEach tag will also contain some instances (lets call them &quot;events&quot;) recording specific actions like in tag &quot;Allowance&quot; there might be an instance that record the amount of money received yearly from a bank&#39;s interest.\r\n\r\nAll of these are fine and I have code them already but when displaying the data, I got stuck.

I plan to sort them and then just pick out the range of events that are between April 21st and 22nd. That&#39;s ok when you are dealing with only the events in a single tag. What I want is to gather all events in all tags that are a child tag of some specified tag, for example I want to gather all events that are in &quot;Allowance&quot; tag, together with it&#39;s 3 child tags&#39; events.\r\n\r\nI plan to approach this sorting problem with a merge sort approach: first I sort the events of &quot;Yearly allowance&quot;, &quot;Monthly allowance&quot; and &quot;Daily allowance&quot;. Then I sort &quot;Allowance&quot;, &quot;Food and drinks&quot;, &quot;Rent&quot; and then &quot;Monetary&quot;.

The key pressed is &lt;i&gt;supposed&lt;/i&gt; to be echoed by the `Console.Write()` call further down, so what actually happens when the program runs is that each key echoes twice.  When I remove the call to `Thread.Sleep()`, everything works as it should, however CPU usage shoots up to 100% while it&#39;s waiting for `Console.KeyAvailable`.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s what I&#39;ve already tried:\r\n\r\n - Removing the `while(!Console.KeyAvailable)` and placing all the code in the loop, except the `Thread.Sleep()` and the interrupt check, inside of an `if(Console.KeyAvailable)`\r\n\r\n - Adding another `Thread.Sleep()` right before and after the call to `Console.ReadKey()`\r\n\r\n - Removing the `Console.Write()` call that echoes the pressed key.  Each key &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; only echo once, however backspace no longer works.  \r\n\r\n - Placing the interrupt checking loop containing the `Thread.Sleep()` in a separate thread and waiting on an `AutoResetEvent` in the main loop containing the `Console.ReadKey()`\r\n\r\n - Running the method asynchronously and using `await Task.Delay()` in place of `Thread.Sleep()`\r\n\r\nNone of these have fixed the issue.  Is there anything I could do to make `Console.ReadKey()` work as intended, such as an alternative to `Console.ReadKey()` or `Thread.Sleep()`?  To put it simply, what I need is something that can limit CPU usage while waiting without causing `Console.ReadKey()` to echo keypresses when it shouldn&#39;t.",

I wrote the following method as a replacement for <code>Console.Readline()</code> with the added functionality of being able to be interrupted.</p>\n\n<pre><code>public static string Readline()\n{\n    Interrupted = false;\n    ConsoleKeyInfo keyInfo;\n    string input = \"\";\n    do\n    {\n        while(!Console.KeyAvailable)\n        {\n            Thread.Sleep(20);\n\n            if(Interrupted)\n            {\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n\n        if(Interrupted)\n        {\n            break;\n        }\n\n        keyInfo = Console.ReadKey(true);\n        if(keyInfo.Key == ConsoleKey.Backspace)\n        {\n            if(input.Length &gt; 0)\n            {\n                input = input.Remove(input.Length - 1, 1);\n                Console.Write(\"\\b \\b\");\n            }\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            input += keyInfo.KeyChar;\n            Console.Write(keyInfo.KeyChar);\n        }\n    }\n    while(keyInfo.Key != ConsoleKey.Enter);\n    Console.WriteLine();\n\n    return input;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The problem here is that calling <code>Thread.Sleep()</code> causes <code>Console.ReadKey()</code> to echo the key pressed, even though <code>true</code> is passed in to <code>Console.ReadKey()</code> to disable echoing. The key pressed is <i>supposed</i> to be echoed by the <code>Console.Write()</code> call further down, so what actually happens when the program runs is that each key echoes twice.  When I remove the call to <code>Thread.Sleep()</code>, everything works as it should, however CPU usage shoots up to 100% while it's waiting for <code>Console.KeyAvailable</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Here's what I've already tried:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Removing the <code>while(!Console.KeyAvailable)</code> and placing all the code in the loop, except the <code>Thread.Sleep()</code> and the interrupt check, inside of an <code>if(Console.KeyAvailable)</code></p></li>\n<li><p>Adding another <code>Thread.Sleep()</code> right before and after the call to <code>Console.ReadKey()</code></p></li>\n<li><p>Removing the <code>Console.Write()</code> call that echoes the pressed key.  Each key <i>does</i> only echo once, however backspace no longer works.  </p></li>\n<li><p>Placing the interrupt checking loop containing the <code>Thread.Sleep()</code> in a separate thread and waiting on an <code>AutoResetEvent</code> in the main loop containing the <code>Console.ReadKey()</code></p></li>\n<li><p>Running the method asynchronously and using <code>await Task.Delay()</code> in place of <code>Thread.Sleep()</code></p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>None of these have fixed the issue.  Is there anything I could do to make <code>Console.ReadKey()</code> work as intended, such as an alternative to <code>Console.ReadKey()</code> or <code>Thread.Sleep()</code>?  To put it simply, what I need is something that can limit CPU usage while waiting without causing <code>Console.ReadKey()</code> to echo keypresses when it shouldn't.</p>\n"

None of the related console.logs in my server.js are logging but the App.js console.logs are registering.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: <strong>Here is my full App.js file:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>import Expo from 'expo';\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { Dimensions, StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';\n\nimport store from './src/store';\nimport { Provider } from 'react-redux';\n\n\n// window.navigator.useragent = 'react-native'; -&gt; not necessary anymore?\n\n\n\nconst ROOT_URL = 'https://myherokudomain.herokuapp.com';\n\nconst io = require('socket.io-client/dist/socket.io');\nconst socket = io.connect(ROOT_URL);\n\n\nsocket.on('connect', () =&gt; {\n     console.log('Connected to server');\n});\n\n\nsocket.on('example', (data) =&gt; {\n    console.log(data);\n\n    socket.emit('my other event', { my: 'data' });\n});\n\n\nsocket.on('disconnect', () =&gt; {\n    console.log('Disconnected from server');\n});\n\nexport default class App extends React.Component {\n\n\nrender() {\n\n// const MainNavigator = my react-navigation system\n\nreturn (\n  &lt;Provider store={store}&gt;\n    &lt;View style={styles.container}&gt;\n      &lt;MainNavigator /&gt;\n    &lt;/View&gt;\n  &lt;/Provider&gt;\n  );\n }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Edit: <strong>Here is my full server.js file:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>const config = require('./config/config');\nconst { mongoose } = require('./db/mongoose');\nconst express = require('express');\n\nconst cors = require('cors');\n\n\nconst app = express();\nconst port = process.env.PORT;\n\n// ************ Include and use separate routes file\napp.use(require('./routes/routes'));\n// ************\n\n\n//Cross-Origin resource sharing. cors library solves CORS problems.\napp.use(cors());\n\n\n//***********\n/* Chat server code*/\n\n\n// enabled heroku session affinity: \n// see https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/session-affinity\n// to enable:   heroku features:enable http-session-affinity\n// to diable:   heroku features:disable http-session-affinity\n\nconst socketIO = require('socket.io');\nconst http = require('http');\n\n\nconst server = http.createServer(app);\n\nconst io = socketIO(server, { origin: \"*:*\" });\n//********** */\n\n\nio.on('connection', (socket) =&gt; {\n    console.log('A client just joined', socket.id);\n\n    socket.emit('example', { hello: 'world' });\n\n    socket.on('my other event', (data) =&gt; {\n        console.log(data);\n    });\n\n\n    socket.on('disconnect', () =&gt; {\n        console.log('User was disconnected');\n    });\n});\n\n\nserver.listen(port, (err) =&gt; {\n    console.log(`started on port ${port}`);\n});\n\n\n\nmodule.exports = { app };\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I am getting the console logs on the client side just fine (for instance, the \"connected to server\" and \"hello: world\" stuff is showing up when I open my app on expo. But I am not getting the server-side console logs. </p>\n\n<p>What am I doing wrong - how do I get socket.io fully working with a deployed React-Native app? </p>\n\n<p>I would really appreciate any help at all! I've been stuck on this forever.</p>\n"
