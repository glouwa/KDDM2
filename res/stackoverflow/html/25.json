            "body": "<p>I'm hoping some concurrency experts can advise as I'm not looking to rewrite something that likely exists. </p>\n\n<p>Picture the <strong>problem</strong>; I have a web connection that comes calling looking for their unique computed result (with a key that they provide in order to retrieve their result) - however the result may not have been computed YET so I would like for the connection to wait (block) for UP TO <em>n</em> seconds before giving up and telling them I don't (yet) have their result (computation time to calculate value is non deterministic). something like;</p>\n\n<pre><code>String getValue (String key)\n    {\n        String value = [MISSING_PIECE_OF_PUZZLE].getValueOrTimeout(key, 10, TimeUnit.SECONDS)\n        if (value == null)\n            return \"Not computed within 10 Seconds\";\n        else\n            return \"Value was computed and was \" + value;\n\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and then have another thread (the computation threads)that is doing the calculations - something like ; </p>\n\n<pre><code>public void writeValues()\n{\n....\n[MISSING_PIECE_OF_PUZZLE].put(key, computedValue)\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In this scenario, there are a number of threads working in the <strong>background</strong> to compute the values that will ultimately be picked up by a web connections. The web connections have NO control or authority over what is computed and when the computations execute - as I've said - this is being done in a pool in the background but these thread can publish when the computation has completed (how they do is the gist of this question)</p>\n\n<p>As these are web connections that will be blocking - i could potentially have 1000s of concurrent connections waiting (subscribing) for their specific computed value so such a solution needs to be very light on blocking resources. The closest i've came to is this SO <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6389122/does-a-hashmap-with-a-getandwait-method-exist-e-g-a-blockingconcurrenthashma\">question</a> which I will explore further but wanted to check i'm not missing something blindly obvious before writing this myself?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/IWISc.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/IWISc.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n"
