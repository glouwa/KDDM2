This means on the different domains/servers we own, our customer-created sites, and third-party sites we will need a very simple way to give this code to people.\r\n\r\nThis Universal Header will also contain some search functionality, which is slightly relevant to my question. Put simply, it will contain JavaScript to change the `action` attribute on its `&lt;form&gt;` element, depending on the dropdown selection, as well as submitting the form.\r\n\r\nThe way we want the header to work, is that it *lives* in one location, we were thinking some kind of HTTP Request to get the header. This will maximize the portability of the Universal Header, in our opinion.\r\n\r\nThe header will need to integrate nicely with WordPress (not a problem), but also with AngularJS, in our discussions, it&#39;s a little less certain whether that will be possible. Thus the &quot;slightly relevant&quot; piece of the search functionality.\r\n\r\nOne of the solutions we talked about was doing it in HTML like [this answer][1], but I&#39;ve always been a little more skittish about requesting raw HTML over HTTP, and just dumping it into a page, but maybe it&#39;s the right way to go, but maybe not? Since we weren&#39;t sure, we thought about the [JIRA Issue Collector][2] where they basically stream JavaScript to their customer that then builds the issue tracker button, fixed on the side of a page which has some HTML, CSS, and JS in it. The user can then click this button, which opens a form ready for submission. That may be an over simplification, but basically, their JS snippet packages HTML/CSS/JS and submits data to their server.\r\n\r\nThis is the direction we have decided to go with this. However, I am wondering a few things:\r\n\r\n - **What are some patterns to deal with the &quot;flash&quot; of the header?** Since it&#39;s JavaScript, on page load, the header will be missing then suddenly be there, how could you deal with that usability problem? I was thinking like a Skeleton area where the header would be, then have the JavaScript replace it, but I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s trite or not.\r\n - **What&#39;s a standard way to bundle the *creation* of HTML, the CSS to style said HTML, and some JavaScript functionality all contained inside a JavaScript file?** I have experience using Angular and React, so I know bundling the styles can be done in JS. I&#39;m just uncertain about the creation of HTML piece. We won&#39;t be using Angular or React for this project, but I do have some familiarity with Webpack, which seems like it could do the job, maybe.\r\n - One thing I&#39;m thinking about is possibly breaking the HTML into a separate HTTP Request, and having the JavaScript and Styles bundled in another HTTP Request -- almost like a web component. In other words, we could request the HTML, and the CSS/JS in parallel and when it returns, just smash it together in the UI. **What are some dangers of doing that, or some things to think about when doing it like that?**\r\n - **What would be a good way to integrate this with AngularJS?** Since this header will have search functionality in it, we need some way of broadcasting (to AngularJS) when someone submits a search, and what that search is they&#39;ve submitted.\r\n\r\nOriginally, for the last point above, I was thinking something like this in pseudo code. Basically, when the header loads, and when AngularJS is done loading, the header will have to get some data from AngularJS/the Window/ whatever -- I prefer window, because its frontend framework agnostic --- telling it what &quot;realm&quot; it is meant to search within. Then, when the user searches within that &quot;realm,&quot; AngularJS will need to be made aware of that event, as well as the data from that event -- like the search string. Maybe the below pseudo code is way off base, but that&#39;s why I&#39;m asking the question:\r\n\r\n    /// inside the SearchController in AngularJS\r\n    $scope.defaultRealm = &#39;products&#39;;\r\n    \r\n    /// to select default realm\r\n    document.when(&#39;angularJSLoads&#39;, function () {\r\n        document.getElementById(&#39;universial-header&#39;).find(&#39;.dropdown&#39;, function () {\r\n            // put actions to select $scope.defaultRealm in the dropdown options.\r\n        })\r\n    })\r\n    \r\n    /// to search in own defaultRealm\r\n    document.querySelector(&#39;.dropdown&#39;).onEvent(&#39;headerSearch&#39;, function (e) {\r\n        e.preventDefault();\r\n        var data = event.target.value;\r\n        \r\n        // do searching in AngularJS\r\n    })\r\n\r\nI was thinking using `window` and `event`s because we could document that as the &quot;right way&quot; to interact with the universal header for the third parties, and customers using it. If there are some better, cleaner ways, I&#39;d be glad to hear about it.\r\n\r\nI appreciate any help with this.
